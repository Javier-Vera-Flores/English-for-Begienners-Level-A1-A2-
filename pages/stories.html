                <h2>story one: Hansel and Gretel</h2>
                <h3>summary</h3>
                <section class="scrolear-storie">
                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a poor woodcutter. He lived with his wife and two children, Hansel and Gretel. They were very poor and had little food to eat.</p>
                    <p>One night, the woodcutter’s wife said, “We have no food. We must leave the children in the forest.” The woodcutter did not want to do it, but he agreed because they had no choice.</p>
                    <p>Hansel heard the plan. He went outside and picked up white stones. He put the stones in his pocket. The next day, the family went into the forest. Hansel dropped the stones on the ground. The parents left Hansel and Gretel in the forest, but the children followed the stones back home.</p>
                    <p>The next night, the woodcutter’s wife said, “We must take the children deeper into the forest.” Hansel wanted to pick up more stones, but the door was locked. The next day, Hansel dropped breadcrumbs on the ground. But the birds ate the breadcrumbs, so Hansel and Gretel got lost.</p>
                    <p>Hansel and Gretel walked in the forest. They found a house made of candy and cake. A witch lived in the house. She gave them food but locked Hansel in a cage. She wanted to eat him. She made Gretel work.</p>
                    <p>One day, the witch told Gretel to check the oven. Gretel pretended she did not know how. When the witch showed her, Gretel pushed her into the oven and closed the door. The witch died.</p>
                    <p>Gretel freed Hansel. They found treasure in the witch’s house. They took the treasure and went home. Their father was happy to see them. Their stepmother had died. With the treasure, they were never poor again. They lived happily ever after.</p>

                <h2>story two: Little Red Riding Hood</h2>
                <h3>summary</h3>
                <section class="scrolear-storie">
                    <p>Once upon a time, there was a little girl who lived in a village near the forest. She always wore a red riding cloak, so everyone called her Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother asked her to take some food to her grandmother, who was ill. Her grandmother lived in a house deep in the woods. Little Red Riding Hood set off with a basket of goodies.</p>
                    <p>As she walked through the forest, she met a wolf. The wolf was very curious and asked her where she was going. "I’m going to visit my grandmother, who is ill," she replied. The wolf had a wicked idea and suggested that she pick some flowers for her grandmother. Little Red Riding Hood agreed and wandered off the path.</p>
                    <p>The wolf quickly ran to the grandmother’s house and knocked on the door. "Who is it?" the grandmother asked. "It’s me, Little Red Riding Hood," the wolf replied, disguising his voice. The grandmother, thinking it was her granddaughter, told him to come in. The wolf entered and quickly swallowed the grandmother whole.</p>
                    <p>Then, the wolf put on the grandmother’s clothes and lay in her bed, waiting for Little Red Riding Hood. When she finally arrived, she noticed that her grandmother looked very strange. "Grandmother, what big ears you have!" she exclaimed. "All the better to hear you with," the wolf replied. Little Red Riding Hood continued, "Grandmother, what big eyes you have!" "All the better to see you with," said the wolf.</p>
                    <p>"Grandmother, what big hands you have!" she remarked. "All the better to hug you with," answered the wolf. Finally, Little Red Riding Hood said, "Grandmother, what big teeth you have!" "All the better to eat you with!" the wolf roared and jumped out of the bed. He chased her around the room, but just then, a woodcutter was passing by the house.</p>
                    <p>The woodcutter heard the commotion and rushed inside. He struck the wolf with his axe and saved Little Red Riding Hood. They cut open the wolf’s belly and found the grandmother alive inside. Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother thanked the woodcutter. From that day on, Little Red Riding Hood promised never to stray from the forest path again.</p>
