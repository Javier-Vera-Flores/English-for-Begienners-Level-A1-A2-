                <h2>Parts of speech</h2>
                <p>Parts of speech are essential elements of English grammar, categorizing words based on their function in a sentence. The primary parts of speech include nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, and interjections. Nouns name people, places, things, or ideas, while pronouns replace nouns to avoid repetition. Verbs express actions or states of being, and adjectives describe or modify nouns and pronouns. Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, providing additional information about how, when, where, or to what extent something happens.</p>
                <p>Prepositions show relationships between nouns (or pronouns) and other words in a sentence, indicating direction, place, time, or manner. Common prepositions include "in," "on," "at," "by," and "with." Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses, coordinating elements to show relationships of equal importance, or subordinating elements to indicate dependence. Examples of conjunctions are "and," "but," "or," "because," and "although." Interjections are expressive words or phrases that convey strong emotions or reactions, such as "oh," "wow," "oops," and "hurray."</p>
                <p>Understanding parts of speech is crucial for constructing clear and grammatically correct sentences. They provide the foundation for sentence structure, helping speakers and writers convey their messages effectively. Mastery of parts of speech allows for better comprehension and use of the English language, enhancing both written and spoken communication. Recognizing and using the different parts of speech correctly can improve language skills and overall fluency.</p>

                <h2>Present simple</h2>
                <p>The present simple tense is used to describe habits, general truths, and repeated actions. It is one of the most common tenses in English, forming the foundation of basic communication. Regular verbs in the present simple tense take the base form, with an added "-s" or "-es" for the third-person singular (he, she, it). For example, "I play," "you play," "he plays," and "she watches." This tense is straightforward and essential for expressing everyday activities and routines.</p>
                <p>To form negative sentences in the present simple, the auxiliary verb "do" is used along with "not." For example, "I do not (don't) like broccoli," "She does not (doesn't) play football." Questions are also formed using the auxiliary verb "do" or "does" for third-person singular. For instance, "Do you like coffee?" and "Does he work here?" The structure is simple, yet versatile, making it easy to ask questions and give negative responses.</p>
                <p>The present simple tense is also used for scheduled events in the near future, especially when they are part of a fixed timetable. For example, "The train leaves at 6 PM" and "The meeting starts at 9 AM." It expresses certainty and regularity, helping to convey information that is considered unchanging. Mastery of the present simple tense is crucial for beginners, as it is the foundation for more complex tenses and structures in English grammar.</p>

                <h2>Past simple</h2>
                <p>The past simple, also known as the "simple past," is used to describe completed actions in the past. It's one of the most common verb tenses in English and is used to talk about specific events that happened at a previous time. Regular verbs in the past simple tense are typically formed by adding "-ed" to the end of the base verb. For example, "walk" becomes "walked," and "talk" becomes "talked."</p>
                <p>Irregular verbs in the past simple have unique forms that don't follow a regular pattern. Some common examples include "go" (past: went), "eat" (past: ate), and "see" (past: saw). It's important to learn these irregular verbs as they don't follow the rules of regular verb formation. The past simple is used for narrating stories, recounting past events, and describing actions that are no longer ongoing.</p>
                <p>To form negative sentences in the past simple, "did not" (didn't) is added before the base verb. For example, "She didn't go to the party." To form questions in the past simple, "did" is used followed by the subject and the base verb. For example, "Did you finish your homework?" The past simple is fundamental for communicating past events clearly and accurately in English.</p>

                <h2>future simple</h2>
                <p>The future simple tense, also known as the "simple future," is used to express actions that will occur at a later time. It is one of the most straightforward ways to talk about future events in English. The future simple is formed using the auxiliary verb "will" or "shall," followed by the base form of the main verb. For example, "I will go to the store tomorrow" and "She shall arrive at noon."</p>
                <p>The future simple tense is commonly used to make predictions, promises, and spontaneous decisions. It can also express willingness or intention to perform an action in the future. For instance, "It will rain later," "I will help you with your project," and "I shall visit my grandmother next weekend." The future simple tense is versatile and can convey a wide range of future possibilities and certainties.</p>
                <p>To form negative sentences in the future simple, "will not" (won't) or "shall not" (shan't) is placed before the base form of the main verb. For example, "He will not attend the meeting" and "She shall not forget to call you." Questions in the future simple are formed by placing "will" or "shall" before the subject, followed by the base form of the main verb. For instance, "Will you be home for dinner?" and "Shall we meet at the usual place?" The future simple tense is essential for expressing future plans, intentions, and predictions with clarity and confidence.</p>
